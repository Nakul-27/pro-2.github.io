LU, CALVIN '24 Co: A4. Conversation with CDT. 
I was having difficulty with getting the map to show up and Calvin showed me that I needed to create a 1:1 map to get it to work.
His help was integral in figuring out how to get off the ground.

                    Vaccinations have become somewhat of a contentious topic due to the increasingly polarizing political climate. 
		                There have been recent reports of Polio resurfacing in the United States due to a growing level of distrust in vaccines.
                    Additionally, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine only served to stir this pot more.
                    <b>I hypothesize that in pockets of the United States, there is a decreasing percentage of Vaccination Coverage among Young Children.</b>
                    <b>Specifically meaning that a growing distrust in vaccines by adults is manifesting itself in children.</b>
                    Note that the term "pockets" refers to a single state or a small (< 5) of states.
                    Ultimately, the topic of "the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines" is dense covering topics of media polarization, political messages, vaccine effectiveness from a statistical stanpoint, growing healthcare costs in the United States, etc, and admittedly, this will only scratch the surface of the topic.
                    Nonetheless, I believed it important to look at.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The ultimate goal of this is to fascilitate a conversation and the exploration of this dense topic by allowing it to be easily viewed.</b>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div>
                    There were two datasets utilized (both from the CDC):
                    <ol>
                        <li> <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Child-Vaccinations/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Young-Children-0-35-Mon/fhky-rtsk/about_data">Vaccination Coverage among Young Children (0 â€“ 35 Months)</a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Immunization-Survey-Adult-COVID-Module-NI/uc4z-hbsd/about_data">COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage and Vaccine Confidence Among Adults</a> </li>
                    </ol>
                    The first one is data on the vaccination of children from the years 2011 - 2022. It contains data on Exemptions, Polio, MMR, etc. The data is broken up by state.
                    The second one is survey data on COVID-19 Vaccines. It contains data on the State, What was Surveyed (Age, Sex, etc.), Category within what was surveyed, Estimate, etc.
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div>
                    Both datasets are incredibly large, particularly the COVID-19 data set, with a lot to explore within each.
                    Both datasets do not overlap in years; however, I do believe that we can see similar trends throughout both, demonstrating the merit of exploring the hypothesis further regardless of vaccine.
                    Additionally, one can get more (detailed) data if they apply for an API key from the CDC. I do not have that and was unable to get approved as I'm not affiliated with one of their partners..
                    <b>In the making of these visualizations, I found wrangling this breadth of data to be difficult, but this is what I found to be the best way to visualize this.</b>
                </div>

                    How to Use:

                        <li>Click "Play" to see the map change over the years</li>
                        <h4>
                            Note: You can drag the slider to have the map stay on a single year. As the map gets lighter (trends from blue to yellow), that correlates to a decreasing percentage of people vaccinated.
                        </h4>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Select the Category within what was surveyed (Ex: Male or Female)</li>
                        <li>Click "Play" to see the map change over the time periods</li>

                            As the map gets lighter (trends from blue to yellow), that correlates to a decreasing percentage of people that answered `yes` to that particular question.

                    Note: The scale starts at 80% because I found percentages to not be much less than that, so starting at 0% would not allow for proper visualization of the data.
                    I experimented with changing the scale and found that to not be helpful.
